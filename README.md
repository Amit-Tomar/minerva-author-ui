# Minerva Author UI

## Running the UI locally

### Local environment
Local environment requires that minerva-author backend is running on the same machine.
```
npm i && npm run start
```
### Cloud environment
Cloud environment uses only endpoints from Minerva Cloud (no local backend is needed).
```
npm i && npm run start:cloud
```

The server will be running on port `8487`.
